# RayTracingTheNextWeek

By studying the famous 'RayTracing' series, I tried to write down my own ray tracing renderer, which currently support following functions below:

- Path tracing using monto carlo integration
- materials rendering include:
  - lambertian material
  - perlin noise texture
  - image texture mapping
  - mixture densities material



Rendering images are as follows:
